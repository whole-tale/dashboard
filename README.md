## A note of PODs and components

Wholetale uses components in the Pods structure and uses this add on:

ember install ember-cli-component-pod

to allow components to be generated in this format. The resulting structure looks like this for a component called shape-3d:

shape-3d/component.js
shape-3d/style.scss
shape-3d/template.js

which allow you to add specific CSS styles, javascript functonality and HTML templates for the 
components. To create a new component, you would use the following Ember CLI:

ember g component-pod shape-3d

which would create the component, template and stylesheet. 

Clean Installation

bower cache clean
bower install --force
bower prune


## Notes

We use Ember truth helpers to make the handle bars code more readable:
